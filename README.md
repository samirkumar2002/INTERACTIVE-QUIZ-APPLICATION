# DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK PERFORMED:

The Interactive Quiz Application is a dynamic and user-friendly web-based platform built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to participate in multiple-choice quizzes, receive instant feedback on their selections, and view their final scores at the end. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how client-side scripting languages can be used to build interactive and responsive web applications without relying on backend technologies.

The application begins with a visually appealing interface that centers the quiz on the screen, providing a seamless experience across devices. When the user opens the quiz, they are presented with a question and multiple options. The user selects their answer by clicking on one of the options. Immediately upon selection, the application highlights the correct answer in green and, if applicable, highlights the incorrect choice in red. This immediate feedback helps users learn from their mistakes in real-time and enhances the interactivity of the application.

Each question is dynamically loaded from a predefined array of question objects stored in JavaScript. This method of dynamic loading ensures that the quiz is scalable and maintainable. Developers can easily add, remove, or modify questions directly in the script without changing the structure of the HTML page. Once a question is answered, the “Next” button appears, allowing the user to proceed to the next question. This step-by-step progression ensures a clear and linear flow of the quiz.

At the end of the quiz, the application displays a summary screen showing the user’s final score. The score is presented in a simple format (e.g., “Your Score: 3 / 4”) that immediately informs users of their performance. This scoring feature motivates users to engage more deeply with the quiz and provides a clear metric of their understanding.

The front-end of the application is styled using CSS to ensure an attractive and intuitive design. Key UI elements such as the quiz container, question text, option buttons, and score display are all visually distinct and responsive to user actions. Buttons change color on hover, and selected answers are visually marked to enhance usability.

The entire application runs on the client-side, which means no data is stored or processed on a server. This makes the app lightweight, fast, and suitable for use in educational websites, training modules, and personal learning tools. Additionally, since it doesn’t require any backend or database, it can be deployed easily on any static hosting platform.

In summary, the Interactive Quiz Application showcases a practical implementation of core web development skills. It combines JavaScript logic, HTML structure, and CSS styling to create a fully functional, interactive tool. The app can be further enhanced with features like timers, score storage, user authentication, and API-based question fetching to make it even more powerful and adaptive to real-world learning scenarios.
